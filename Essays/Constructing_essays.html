    <h4><a name = "Usingevidence">Using Evidence</a></h4>
      <p>Evidence can come from many source but should includes fact from reliable source</p>
      <p>Evidence should be integrated into your essays through quoting, paraphrasing or summarising. All sources quoted must be in the <a href="http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/studyskills/studyskills/media/formatting_reference_list.mp4">reference list at the end of your work.</a></p>
    <h4><a name = "Reviewyourwriting">Review your writing</a></h4>
      <p>Review your paragraphs.</p>
      <p>Make sure that each of your paragraphs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>discusses a key idea</li>
        <li>provides the supporting evidence for the key idea</li>
        <li>brings together the subsidiary points that help to establish your line of argument.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Review your draft essay.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>After you have written a draft of your essay it will be necessary to review what you have achieved. An effective method is to read through each paragraph in the order that they appear in your draft. Write a one sentence summary of each paragraph: </li>
        <li>Read each summary sentence, one after the other:</br>
          If there is no logical connection or continuity between each summary sentence then a rewrite or reordering of the paragraphs will be needed. This might also be needed if there is no thematic continuity between them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have returned to your draft you will need to ask yourself a series of crucial questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does it answer the question or topic as set?</li>
        <li>Is the argument consistent?</li>
        <li>Is the argument convincing?</li>
        <li>Does the evidence support the argument?</li>
        <li>Are the ideas clearly expressed?</li>
        <li>Is the length appropriate?</li>
      </ul>
